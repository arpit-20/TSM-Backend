      <p>The Shock Mechanica(TSM) is made to help out with DAMPER problems as we have generally observed teams go for new dampers every year instead of repairing them.
        We are delighted to know you that <b>The Shock Mechanica</b> comes up with <b>Servicing, Repairing and Tuning </b> for Dampers. We have quality experienced in FOX series as we had witnessed the <b>FOX</b>  repairing during our <b>visit in USA</b>  and were able to import official tools and materials to work with.
        The Shock Mechanica offer <b> General Servicing and Performance Serving </b>in a very minimal <i class="fa fa-inr" aria-hidden="true"></i>prices. <br><br></p>
